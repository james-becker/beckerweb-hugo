## Addiction

I don't care who you are—at some point in your life you've had an addiction. In fact, most of us have had a number of addictions throughout our lives, some of which we might not even be aware of! I have definitely had my fair share, most of which I've beaten, so I feel qualified to talk about this subject.



Although addiction includes things like alcoholism, gambling, and addiction to hard drugs, things we read and hear about every day, it isn't limited to those things. Addiction can also be things nobody talks about: sex addiction, addiction to pulling your hair out (yes, some people suffer from this—I did at one point!) or even negative thought addiction (a form of obsessive compulsive disorder). Addiction is probably hiding somewhere in many people's minds. They simply may not be aware of it. And it could very well be holding them back.



So if addiction can be any number of completely different things, then how might we define this nebulous term?  Merriam-Webster defines it as a "compulsive need for and use of a habit-forming substance (as heroin, nicotine, or alcohol) characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal" or more broadly as  "persistent compulsive use of a substance known by the user to be harmful." Im going to expand that definition to include more than simple use of substances and include "actions" as well.



Let's look at the two key elements of addiction:



1. It's compulsive. Have you ever had an urge to do something that you knew would make you feel great for a short time, but leave you feeling worse in the end? Or maybe this addiction was something you simply did without even thinking about it—almost like a reaction to some external stimulus in your life. If you've ever had the feeling of "I need this right now!" And it's not food or water that you're talking about, you've probably been addicted to something. You could very well have addictions right now.



1. It's habit-forming. This element of an addiction makes them easy to spot. Take one of my all-time most unbeatable addictions: coffee. My addiction to coffee has been one of the only elements of continuity in my ever-changing life. No matter what continent I'm on, no matter what my lifestyle is, whether I'm hot, cold, depressed, or excited, I will drink coffee in the morning. Coffee's place on my morning ritual is so important that I make sure I always drink it out of a special mug. And I'm not unaware of the benefits of quitting coffee. I suffered from insomnia, and one of the key methods to combating insomnia is to quit drinking coffee, because coffee has a negative influence on sleep cycles. Coffee also increases stress hormone production, leading to irritability. I've tried to quit drinking coffee, but I'm still physiologically and psychologically attached to this substance. Thankfully, coffee addiction is actually praised in our society, and its ill effects are few, so I'll mention another addiction I once had that I eventually broke free from: washing my hands. Yes, I used to be neurotically obsessed with washing my hands. I'd wash them before every meal, after every meal, I'd wash them after shaking someone's hand, and I'd even wash them after touching a doorknob. It was absolutely compulsive, and there was no escaping this voice in my head that told me I had to wash my hands after I had exposed them to any foreign substance. At its worst, this habit left my hands looking dry, chapped, itchy and constantly looking like they were about to bleed. How did I finally break free from this cycle? Like quitting any addiction, it involved an increase in my *level of consciousness,* coupled with the *tools to succeed*.



Today, I'd like to inspire you to increase your awareness and locate any addictions you might be ignoring in your life. Think of your daily routine, think of what you do when you get home from work, and think about what you do on the weekends. Think about what you spend your money on, whether it's things or activities. Track your mental thought processes and whenever you catch yourself "feening" for something—obsessively desiring it—make a note of what it is you're so focused on getting or doing. Make a physical note if you're able. Only by becoming aware of our addictions can we take steps to eliminate them.
