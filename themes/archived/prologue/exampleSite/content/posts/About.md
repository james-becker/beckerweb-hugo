## Why did you create this site?

I created this site because there's a necessity for self-expression in today's world and most people aren't filling that need in a healthy fashion. Two common approaches are to use social media, which is the laziest way, and which takes almost no effort at all, but in the end the final product isn't anything one might be proud of. Eventually one ends up being controlled by the social media rather than controlling it, and worst of all, one isn't even legally the owner of one's own social media data.

Additionally, while I'm a career programmer, the place in me which programming occupies is seated squarely in my cranium, about 24 inches from my heart, where my passions for music, writing, philosophy, psychology, art, and social dynamics lies. Since I compose, think, and explore in writing many facets of life, I created this site as a repository for those various creations.
