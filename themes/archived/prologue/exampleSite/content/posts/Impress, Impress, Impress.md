Impress, Impress, Impress



Write emails. Write a lengthy email update every Friday, and when the client missed meetings I started writing a 300-500 word email to keep them “in the loop”







Have you noticed when you adjust your posture, those around you will follow?  Seriously, try sitting sort of hunched over at a table at a cafe, and then sort of adult your posture, and those around you who are “aware” will also adjust theirs. Especially if they are guys, I’ve noticed. I think it’s a Male sexual communication thing. It increases power. I also always keep my feet firmly planted on the ground when I’m sitting at a table.



Other key points when I draw attention back to my posture are when I’m jogging (it’s easy for the shoulders to become tight while jogging), and when I’m sitting working.
