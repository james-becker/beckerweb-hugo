## FAQs

### Can you speak, read, or write Thai?

I can speak Thai at the street level. Learning conversational Thai is really not all that hard. Even if you have no experience with foreign languages, it's far easier than learning Spanish, French, or German.

Reading and writing Thai is another matter. Because the Thai language has 59 letters (33 more than English), learning to read and write Thai can be quite difficult. I can read and write, but in practice, I don't usually need to do so as much as I need to engage in conversation.

### How do you get around the city?

I own a scooter, which allows me to travel throughout the city with the greatest of ease. I can easily do errands, grocery shop, and even take friends (or my girlfriend) for rides in the city.

When my destinations are on the other side of the city, I take public transportation. Taxis are far more affordable in Bangkok (hailing for just about 1 USD) than they are in the US. Bangkok also has somewhat extensive Sky Train and Subway lines. Although they don't match the complexity or reach of systems in cities such as New York or Tokyo, they serve my purposes.

### How much do you pay for rent?

I rent a 2nd-tier condo in central Bangkok. The typical price range for condos at this tier range from 14,000 to 19,000 THB (450-620 USD) per month.  When I show photos or videos of my condo to my friends back home, their jaws typically drop in awe at the comfort I can afford for that price. I can get a luxury unit in Bangkok, replete with amenities and close to the Sky Train, for the same amount of money that gets them a cockroach-infested, garden-level room in a boring American suburb.

### Why did you move to Thailand?

As you can read about in another blog post of mine (Guide to Teaching English in Southeast Asia), my original intention was to move to South Korea to teach English. That didn't work out, however, due to my own impatience. I found myself in Thailand because a friend of a friend lived in Bangkok and suggested I come visit. A strong spirit of adventure and "seeing the world" was originally what brought me to Thailand, but it was the people, the culture and the country itself that led me to stay.
