## I'm James.

Over 5 years ago, I was at a low point in my life. I had a decent job, but my heart wasn't in it. After a series of broken relationships, and finishing up a work contract, I finally decided to take my future into my own hands and make a drastic change.

## That decision led me to Southeast Asia.

My original plan had been to go to South Korea, but that didn't work out (you can read about the details in another blog post). Instead, I found myself staggering off a plane—after a grueling 34-hour journey—into hot, tropical Thailand.

## And I fell in love.

Not with a woman. With a country, a culture, and a people. Thailand had so much to offer: interesting opportunities and engagements, proximity to many other countries, and a healthy attitude to work-life balance.

## So, here I am.

Today I'm in a place of financial stability, legal employment, and comfort that I never could have imagined possessing when I began my journey.

## And you can be, too.

Consider me a resource to your journey, whether you're a traveler setting out to explore this area of the world, or if you have dreams of relocating indefinitely to this peaceful and beautiful country.

I've always taken great pride in considering myself an "enabler" and an "encourager". I like helping people—not by contributing to faceless charities, but by helping directly. I've learned so much about Thailand, and I'm eager to share my knowledge with you.

## So, read on!
