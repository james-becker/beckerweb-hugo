      <description>Displaying and Killing Open Connections via Postgres Queries The pg_stat_activity table can display all current connections to all databases. This is useful if you need to kill connections to perform some database-level activity, such as renaming an imported database.
select pid as process_id, usename as username, datname as database_name, client_addr as client_address, application_name, backend_start, state, state_change from pg_stat_activity;  This query lists the pids of the connection processes you may want to kill.</description>

      <description>FAQs Can you speak, read, or write Thai? I can speak Thai at the street level. Learning conversational Thai is really not all that hard. Even if you have no experience with foreign languages, it&amp;rsquo;s far easier than learning Spanish, French, or German.
Reading and writing Thai is another matter. Because the Thai language has 59 letters (33 more than English), learning to read and write Thai can be quite difficult.</description>
